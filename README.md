This repository contains all the source files used in RStudio to generate the following visualisations in Plot.ly:

1. Grants by Income Level: https://plot.ly/~rebekahlow/7
2. Marriage and Flat Construction Rate - https://plot.ly/~rebekahlow/9/
3. Marriage and Divorce Rate - https://plot.ly/~rebekahlow/11/
4. Marriage Rate by Age Group (Line Chart) - https://plot.ly/~rebekahlow/13/
5. Marriage Rate by Age Group (Pie Chart) - https://plot.ly/~rebekahlow/15
6. Marriage Rate by Age Group (Animated Chart) - https://plot.ly/~rebekahlow/17/

For Grants by Income Level plot, the data used is webscapped from http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/first-timer-and-second-timer-couple-applicants, from the Calculation of Grant Amount table.
The specific columns are 'Half of Average Monthly Income over 12 Months' and 'Total' (from November 2015 sales launches).

For the rest of the plots, the data used is from data.gov.sg, however the dataset that was used in this project has already been taken down by the website.
